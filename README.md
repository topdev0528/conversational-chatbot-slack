In this articles, we are going to build a chatbot called ‘Robo’ capable of checking in on people’s mood and taking the necessary actions to cheer them up. We will then deploy it to Slack. It will be a fully function Slackbot capable of listening and responding to your requests. The demo screenshot below should motivate you enough to build one of your own.
